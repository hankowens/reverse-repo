# reverse-repo
This is intended to house some of my research projects on economics and banking. The name is a pun on the banking term for "repo" -- a repurchase agreement, which is a short-term debt instrument. A reverse repo is a sub type of repo. In late sumer 2008, during the worst of the financial crisis, the short-term debt markets collapsed. This lead to, among other things, the failure of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of AIG. 

See for example Gorton and Metrick 2009 for a look at this episode. https://www.nber.org/papers/w15223
